# Hi Everyone!
This repository is for students of __E-115__.  It will provide any and all code covered in labs/recitation.  The README will specify what is covered in each lab as well as when each lab was conducted.  Feel free to download this code and play with it, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach me at: _mfreema1@stevens.edu_

## Lab 3 - Integers, floats, doubles, and the iostream - 9/19/2018
These are all what are called "data types".  We operate on them using what are called operators.  The `numbers.cpp` file will show you how we create instances of these data types and manipulate them.  We will also go over some limitations of these data types and some of how they operate under the hood.

We'll also briefly cover something called _typecasting_, which allows one data type to act like another in an expression.

## Lab 4 - Chars, strings, and string functions - 9/26/2018
Characters and strings are both data types.  They differ from ints, floats, and doubles by
storing text instead of numbers.  The `strings.cpp` file will show instantiation of characters and strings.  This will also cover some different ways to look at strings, as well as how to operate on them and observe some of their properties.
