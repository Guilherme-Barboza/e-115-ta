# Hi Everyone!
This repository is for students of __E-115__.  It will provide any and all code covered in labs/recitation.  The README will specify what is covered in each lab as well as when each lab was conducted.  Feel free to download this code and play with it, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach me at: _mfreema1@stevens.edu_

## Lab 3 - Integers, floats, doubles, and the iostream - 9/19/2018
These are all what are called "data types".  We operate on them using what are called operators.  The `numbers.cpp` file will show you how we create instances of these data types and manipulate them.  We will also go over some limitations of these data types and some of how they operate under the hood.

We'll also briefly cover something called _typecasting_, which allows one data type to act like another in an expression.

## Lab 4 - Chars, strings, and string functions - 9/26/2018
Characters and strings are both data types.  They differ from ints, floats, and doubles by
storing text instead of numbers.  The `strings.cpp` file will show instantiation of characters and strings.  This will also cover some different ways to look at strings, as well as how to operate on them and observe some of their properties.

## Lab 5 - If/else, conditionals, and switch - 10/3/2018
If/else and switch are both statements that allow us to modify the flow of our programs.  To control which branch of these statements get executed, we use conditionals.  Conditionals check one value against another to determine if a block should be executed.  Conditionals for if/else and switch statements behave somewhat differently, the semantics of which, we will cover.  The lab file `conditionals.cpp` shows examples of all of these constructs, explaining their use and functionality along the way.

## Lab 6 - For and while loops - 10/10/2018
For and while loops are ways of repeating a procedure based off of conditions in our code.  In `loops.cpp`, we will go over the differences between these two constructs and show some examples of them along the way.  We will also go over how to choose which one to implement in a given scenario.
